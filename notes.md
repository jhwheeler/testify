# Requirements

Create a front end that takes JSON and displays:

* test coverage for given files
* total lines of code for given files
* user should see relative coverage of lines across all files in the directory and its subdirectories
* assume large numbers (as in [https://gist.github.com/royletron/f535f03830c92cf840665831e8d3d528](this gist))
